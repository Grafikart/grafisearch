# GrafiSearch

A custom web server to serve as a personal search engine.

## Why ?

I couldn't find a search engine that matches my needs :

- The page must be fast
- Bangs (!rt, !wrenfr...)
- Custom theme
- Instant answers (timer, colors...)
- Fill the whole screen
- Remove undesired result (pinterest, allocine, jeuxvideos.com...)
- No ads

## How ? 

The goal is to have a binary that starts a webserver with my system. This server will fetch the results.
